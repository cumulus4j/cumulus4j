Supported algorithms

* Symmetric encryption

** Block cipher


** Stream cipher


* Asymmetric encryption

	At the moment, RSA is the only supported asymmetric encryption algorithm. This will likely change soon.

* Block cipher operation modes

	When using a block cipher, an

* MAC

	TODO document this!
