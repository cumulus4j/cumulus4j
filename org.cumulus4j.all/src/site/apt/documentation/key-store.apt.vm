Key store

	Your data in the encrypted database is only as secure as your keys. Someone getting your keys can access
	all your data. Therefore your keys require protection.
	
	First of all, the keys are always stored far away from your database, i.e. never at the cloud service provider.
	Where exactly you keep your keys is your decision. Cumulus4j provides various possibilities:
	
	* You can keep your keys on your client computer(s).
	
	* You can store them on a USB thumb drive, which you connect to your classic key ring.
	
	* You can use a key server to manage your keys. This key server could be run in your office or somewhere
	in the internet; though the hoster of your key-server should be someone who has no relationship
	to your cloud service provider, of course.
	
	[]
	
	Take a look at the {{{./deployment-scenarios.html}Deployment scenarios}} to get a better understanding of
	this.

* Protection by encryption

	The keys in your key store are encrypted and thus protected even if you loose your classic key ring with
	your key store being on a USB thumb drive. Only those people having a user-name and password to your key
	store can access your keys.
	
	By default, the key store uses very strong encryption: {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twofish}Twofish}}
	with 256 bit keys and {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode}GCM}} to protect it against
	data manipulation or corruption.
	
	Note: You need a backup, as GCM does only detect manipulation/corruption and is not able to magically
	repair it! But you need a backup, anyway, because you might loose your key store due to a broken hard disk,
	a lost thumb drive or other reasons.

* Key size

	By default, keys have a length of 256 bit. But it is possible to specify a different key length (needs to be
	specified during initialisation!).

	Important: The key store determines, which key size is used to encrypt your database!

* Date-dependent key-strategy

	Keys are rotated from time to time. By default, one key is valid for one day, but you can choose otherwise
	if you want to.
	
	See {{{./date-dependent-key-strategy.html}Date-dependent key-strategy}} for further details.

* Initialisation

	Before you can use a key-store, you have to initialise it. Initialisation comprises creation of at least one user
	and all keys. Currently, the only strategy supported is the 'Date-dependent key-strategy', hence the initialisation
	works via this strategy.
	
	The easiest way to perform an initialisation is the CLI (command line interface). You need to download
	<<<org.cumulus4j.keymanager.cli-${project.version}.jar>>> and then use the
	<<<initDateDependentKeyStrategy>>> sub-command like this:
	
+----------------------------------+
java -jar org.cumulus4j.keymanager.cli-${project.version}.jar initDateDependentKeyStrategy -keyStoreID MY-KEY-STORE -userName USER1
+----------------------------------+
	
	There are quite a few options available and you might want to use the following command to learn more about this command: 
	
+----------------------------------+
java -jar org.cumulus4j.keymanager.cli-${project.version}.jar help initDateDependentKeyStrategy
+----------------------------------+

* Module

	The following modules are related to the key-store and you might want to continue reading these documents:

	{{{../org.cumulus4j.keystore/}org.cumulus4j.keystore}} - the actual key-store.
	
	{{{../org.cumulus4j.keymanager.api/}org.cumulus4j.keymanager.api}} - API to access a key-store (locally or on a remote key-server).
	
	{{{../org.cumulus4j.keymanager.cli/}org.cumulus4j.keymanager.cli}} - Command line interface to work with a key-store (locally or on a remote key-server).
